        Porsche developed a prototype electric Porsche Boxster called the
        Boxster E in 2011[79] and a hybrid version of the 911 called the GT3 R
        Hybrid, developed with Williams Grand Prix Engineering in 2010.[80] In
        July 2014, Porsche announced the launch by the end of 2014 of the
        Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid a plug-in hybrid, which will displace the
        Cayenne S Hybrid from the lineup. The S E-Hybrid will be the first
        plug-in hybrid in the premium SUV segment and will allow Porsche to
        become the first automaker with three production plug-in hybrid
        models.[81] In July 2017, Porsche installed its first 350 kW, 800V
        charging station, which the upcoming Porsche Mission E will use. As of
        2017, the Porsche charging station is the fastest electric vehicle
        charging station in the world, being able to charge a Porsche Mission E
        up to 80% within 15 minutes. Porsche is also currently working with
        other manufacturers to make Porsche charging stations compatible with
        other electric vehicles.[82] In August 2018, Porsche announced that the
        formerly named Mission E electric car will be named "Taycan" meaning
        'leaping horse'.[83] The prototype electric car is expected to be
        revealed in 2019 after its completion.

        The history of AUDI AG extends back to the 19th century. Find out more
        about the great personalities from the company’s 100-plus years of
        history. Learn about the fascinating evolution of the various models and
        major milestones in the fields of car manufacturing, motorcycle, engine
        production and motor racing. udi AI is a driver assist feature offered
        by Audi. The company's stated intent is to offer fully autonomous
        driving at a future time, acknowledging that legal, regulatory and
        technical hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal. On 4 June 2017,
        Audi stated that its new A8 will be fully self-driving for speeds up to
        60 km/h using its Audi AI. Contrary to other cars, the driver will not
        have to do safety checks such as touching the steering wheel every 15
        seconds to use this feature. The Audi A8 will therefore be the first
        production car to reach level 3 autonomous driving, meaning that the
        driver can safely turn their attention away from driving tasks, e.g. the
        driver can text or watch a movie. Audi will also be the first
        manufacturer to use a 3D Lidar system in addition to cameras and
        ultrasonic sensors for their AI

        Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued
        participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where it is the
        oldest and most successful racing team, holding the most constructors'
        championships (16) and having produced the highest number of drivers'
        championship wins Enzo Ferrari was not initially interested in the idea
        of producing road cars when he formed Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, with
        headquarters in Modena. Scuderia Ferrari literally means "Ferrari
        Stable" and is usually used to mean "Team Ferrari." Ferrari
        bought,[citation needed] prepared, and fielded Alfa Romeo racing cars
        for gentleman drivers, functioning as the racing division of Alfa Romeo.
        In 1933, Alfa Romeo withdrew its in-house racing team and Scuderia
        Ferrari took over as its works team

        Mercedes-Benz cars are an important part of the history of the car with
        many "firsts”. They were the first to build a diesel-powered car in the
        1930s, the first to build a car with fuel injection in the 1950s and the
        first to offer antilock brakes in the 1970s. Mercedes-Benz cars have
        also been important in auto racing history. Mercedes-Benz is a brand of
        cars, trucks, buses and coaches from the Daimler AG company of Germany.
        The company was once known as Daimler-Benz and is still sometimes called
        just "Mercedes." Mercedes-Benz is the world's oldest car maker and the
        cars they make cost a lot of money. The symbol of Mercedes-Benz is very
        famous. It is a three-pointed star inside of a circle and was designed
        by one of the men who started the company, Gottlieb Daimler. The three
        points of the star stand for land, air and sea because Daimler's engines
        were used not only in cars and trucks but in airplanes and boats. The
        symbol was first used in 1909.

      <i>
        The company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a
        machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both
        companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest
        conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota
        Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine
        in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA. After World
        War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to
        learn from American automakers and other companies, which would give
        rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota
        Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that would transform
        the small company into a leader in the industry and would be the subject
        of many academic studies. In the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of a
        rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to a growing middle-class,
        leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which would go on to
        become the world's all-time best-selling automobile. The booming economy
        also funded an international expansion that would allow Toyota to grow
        into one of the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in
        Japan and the ninth-largest company in the world by revenue, as of
        December 2020.

        Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc
        Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor
        and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a $6.5
        million investment, Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the
        company. He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose
        of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and
        energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began
        production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2009.
        This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015,
        the Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the Model Y crossover in 2020. The Model
        3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and, in
        June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1 million units
        globally.[9] Tesla's global sales were 936,222 cars in 2021, a 87%
        increase over the previous year,[10] and cumulative sales totaled 2.3
        million cars at the end of 2021.[11] In October 2021, Tesla's market
        capitalization reached $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S.
        history.
