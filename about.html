        >The importance of the private car Driving a car is important for people
        in general because it provides status and the opportunity for personal
        control and autonomy [29][108]. In sparsely populated areas, owning a
        car is even more important, since it provides the only opportunity for
        travelling long distances due to a lack of public transport. For older
        people, having more difficulties walking (to the bus stop) and cycling,
        driving is often the only option for independent mobility. Several
        studies have found that over 90% of older drivers indicate that giving
        up driving would restrict their independence and mobility [92][59]. The
        same drivers expressed anxiety about the poor quality of public
        transport services. This anxiety seemed to be based on reality because
        50% of those respondents who already had given up driving felt public
        transport to be, at least in some measure, inadequate [92]. Before older
        people stop driving, they usually reduce how much they drive and limit
        their driving to local journeys in familiar areas and under easy driving
        conditions. The better the provision of alternative means of mobility,
        the more likely a driver is to start using them for journeys he or she
        would prefer not to drive, long before ceasing to drive. This makes it
        easier to remain mobile after ceasing to drive. The lack of attractive
        and feasible transport alternatives to the private automobile, coupled
        with land-use patterns that make walking difficult or impossible,
        contributes to the problems experienced by people who have to stop
        driving, notably in North America. However, similar problems occur in
        Europe for older people living in suburbs and rural locations, as they
        increasingly do. In Great Britain, older drivers appear to be more
        likely to stop driving if they live in urban areas where walking, buses
        and taxis offer realistic mobility alternatives . The ability to go
        everywhere and do everything without a car is also mentioned in surveys
        on reasons for driving less. However, the most important factors for
        ceasing to drive seem to be safety, health, and finance . Men
        more often give up driving because of bad health. Women tend to retire
        from the wheel earlier and for less pressing reasons, such as driving
        seldom
